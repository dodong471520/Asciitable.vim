I don't even remember why I originally needed this, but it will open up a split and create an ASCII table in decimal, hex, or octal.  Mappings are made to:
<leader>a, <leader>a8, <leader>a10, <leader>ax, and <leader>a16.

NOTE:  this is only tested on Win2K, and it was not exhaustively tested for different fonts/character sets.  I'd be curious to know how other platforms react to it.

The code to split the window is based on that found in calendar.vim by Yasuhiro Matsumoto.
